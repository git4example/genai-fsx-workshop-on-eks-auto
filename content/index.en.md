title: "Build GenAI & ML for Performance and Scale, using Amazon EKS, Amazon FSx and AWS Inferentia"
weight: 0
---

In this workshop you will build a Generative AI based interactive Chat application, using a vLLM (for model serving), an open source Foundation Model, along with the following AWS services stack:

* Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) - Orchestration layer
* Amazon FSx for Lustre & Amazon S3 -  host the AI model and data
* AWS Inferentia - Accelerated compute layer


 You will get hands on with configuring and deploying components across Amazon EKS, Amazon FSx, Amazon S3 and AWS Inferentia to build your own Generative AI Chat application. You will learn how you can easily leverage this pattern to build/test your own Generative AI and ML workloads. You will also conduct tests related to performance, scale and integration at the data layer, and learn how you can seamlessly share generated data across AWS Regions.
